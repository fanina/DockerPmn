# Project :
     Dockernize a Symfony project and configure development environment for the project via docker.

In this project there is all the stack that needs a symfony project to start using containers that are managed with docker-compose tool.

the services :
    `nginx` server version 1.19.0-alpine
    `php-server` version 7.4-cli
    `db` mysql version 8.0

Inside the container php, commandes to activate the CRUD were excecuted, for doing that we needed to create entitys(Students) on which we applied `CRUD`.
